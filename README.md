# Dom-manipulation

Simple Exercise of Dom manipulation in Odin Project.
The exercise requires you to do this steps:

a paragraph with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”

an h3 with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”

a div with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:

another h1 that says “I’m in a div”
a paragraph that says “ME TOO!”

Hint for this one: after creating the div with createElement, append the h1 and paragraph to it before adding it to the container.

It also cover a little about event listeners...the code will be commented since you can't have more than 1 onclick
property.
